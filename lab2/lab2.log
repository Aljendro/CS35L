1. The first thing that I managed to do is to change
   the locale to "C" by placing the
   export LC_ALL="C" in my .bash_profile file so that
   everytime that I open linux I can have the locale
   set
2. I managed to sort the contents into a file by
   using the usual sort /path/to/directory >> file
   command. Worked pretty well
3. The first command printed all words (even the 
   html tags). If it had a number it cut out the
   number and only took the letters. There were
   a lot of spaces inbetween these words and
   letters.
4. The next command stripped any empty lines that
   were present from the last command. The -s
   option is literally replace repeated characters
   with only one of that character
5. The third command sorted the list from the
   previouse command
6. The option to sort ( -u ) removed any duplicates
   from the sorting function.
7. The pipeline to the next command comm - words
   creates three columns where the first column
   shows the words only in the web page
   The second column is the words only in
   the file words and the third file is all the
   words that are common in both files
8. The last command with the option -23 to comm
   suppresses the second and third columns from
   the command comm. It essentially shows only
   the words that are only in on the webpage
   like 'www'.
9. Some of the commands that I had to learn how to
   use for the sed command and the tr command. 
   Some of things that I learned from the sed 
   command were that you can delete a patter
   you can capture and replay a pattern and
   finally you can search a pattern and replace
   it with whatever you like. For the tr command
   you can switch whatever character into another
   character.
10. The things I did was delete all the stuff 
    around the list of English to Hawaiian words
    using the delete ability of sed over multiple
    lines. Next I deleted all the extra tags like
    the <u> </u> tag from the hawaiian words. I 
    Then deleted some more stuff around the 
    Hawaiian words including the <tr> tags. 
    There were ^M characters that were not letting
    sort do its job, so I deleted those as well.
    Finally, I sorted and deleted all the words
    that had bad non-hawaiian characters in them.

11. When running the spell checker there were 
    456 misspelled words for English and 479
    misspelled words on the Hawaiian.

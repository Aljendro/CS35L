1. The first thing that I managed to do is to change
   the locale to "C" by placing the
   export LC_ALL="C" in my .bash_profile file so that
   everytime that I open linux I can have the locale
   set
2. I managed to sort the contents into a file by
   using the usual sort /path/to/directory >> file
   command. Worked pretty well
3. The first command printed all words (even the 
   html tags). If it had a number it cut out the
   number and only took the letters. There were
   a lot of spaces inbetween these words and
   letters.
4. The next command stripped any empty lines that
   were present from the last command. The -s
   option is literally replace repeated characters
   with only one of that character
5. The third command sorted the list from the
   previouse command
6. The option to sort ( -u ) removed any duplicates
   from the sorting function.
7. The pipeline to the next command comm - words
   creates three columns where the first column
   shows the words only in the web page
   The second column is the words only in
   the file words and the third file is all the
   words that are common in both files
8. The last command with the option -23 to comm
   suppresses the second and third columns from
   the command comm. It essentially shows only
   the words that are only in on the webpage
   like 'www'.

1. The reason that Brady's patch removed
   the case_long_iso_time_style: was for 
   the reason that it was not needed any
   longer. The old source code 
   contained a goto statement that would
   jump to that location, but it was
   removed. It was not necessary to the 
   remove the line to have the program 
   work, but it was necessary for the 
   purpose of cleaner code. 
2. The main opponent to changing your
   code with the temporary workound would
   have to be that it might break later 
   updates to the system. Any code that 
   relied on various lines of code may
   not work properly. 
3. When the python script is invoked on an
   empty file, it shows a list index out of
   range error.
4. When invoked with Python3 interpreter, the
   error message that goes to STDOUT shows 
   a syntax error. The reason is that python3
   has different syntax for printing strings
   and raising exceptions than python2

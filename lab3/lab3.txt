1. Had to download the tar file from the 
   link given to us. Found a helpful
   command curl -O <url>, which allowed
   me to download the file into the current
   directory with the same name as the url, 
   but without the path
2. I now needed to unzip the tar file, so I 
   managed to research a command, namely 
   the tar command to unzip the file into a
   specified directory. The command was:
   tar -xvf <tarfile>.
3. The next step was to using the ./configure
   script supplied in the directory to check
   configure my system for the coreutils.
4. Next was to use the make file provided so
   that all the files and dependencies can
   be compiled on the linux system.
5. Ran the ./ls -l <path> and found that indeed
   the command from the coreutils did not 
   output the unix style date to STDOUT. 
   Proceeded with the Brady patch.
6. Found the lines that needed to be deleted
   and the lines to be added for the patch
7. ran make
8. Checked the files to see if the patch was
   successful. I ran the command on several 
   files and they all displayed the right 
   format for the dates

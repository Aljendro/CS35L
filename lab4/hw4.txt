2. Used the command ( just like
   in the lab):
   git checkout v3.0 -b "quote"
3. Used the command ( just like
   in the lab):
   patch -p1 < <patch-file>
4. Had a seperate window showing
   Professor Eggerts commit message
   to see how to format the
   change log file. Used
   C-x 4 a to modify the change
   log file in emacs.
5. Used emacs M-w to copy the
   change log and pasted into
   my commit message by using
   C-y in emacs.
7. Used the command:
   git format-patch -1 <SHA>
   to create a patch file for
   the commit
8. -Used the same command as 2.
   to createa another branch
   with v3.0 of the code.
   -Then used the git am command
   to apply the patch file
   -ran ./bootstrap
   -ran ./configure
   -ran make
   -ran make check
   Everything seemed to work
   properly for the generated
   patch
9. There were some intial problems
   with the change log, which
   were apparent because the
   words were not being higlighted
   the same as the other change log
   entries. Used the command:
   git commit --amend to fix the
   problem. After several tries
   I was able to see that emacs
   highlighted the entries in
   the right way.

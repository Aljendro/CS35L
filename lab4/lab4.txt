1. -Cloned repo using git clone <repo>
   command
2. -Got the output of git log into
   the corresponding file using:
   git log >> <file>

3. -Got the git tags in a similar
   fashion
4. -Found the right SHA hash in git
   log by using:
   git log --all --grep='<search>'
   -Got the patch by using:
   git format-patch -1 <SHA>
5. -Got the 3.0 version of the
   repo by creating a new branch.
   The command used was:
   git checkout v3.0 -b <name>
6. -Used the command:
   patch -p1 < <file> to apply
   the patch.
   -There were some rejections
   that were placed in .rej files.
   There were also .orig files that
   were created.
8. -Opened each file that was changed
   by the patch in emacs and used the
   commands:
   C-x v = ( to see the diff file with
       	   the changed applied)
   C-c C-c ( to check the source code
       	   and see if it was applied
	   correctly)
   C-c C-a ( to rever the hunks that
       	   were improperly patched)

9. -Removed the files that were not .c
   or .h from the git modified list by
   using the command it suggested.
10. Went through all the .rej files and
    found some that were not applied.
    Did these by hand
11. Deleted all .orig files to stop
    git from bringing them up in git
    status
12. Added the patch to a new file using
    method of 2.
13. -Used the instructions that were
    suggested in the README-hacking
    file.
    -Tested the output of the commands
    and found that the quoting was
    patched
14. -Copied the directories (patched vs.
    unpatched ) using:
    cp -avr <directory>
    Then ran my patched diff on them
15. -Using the system diff, compared the
    output of 14. to the patched from 12.
    -The only difference between the two
    files was that my diff cut some lines
    short and it came up as differences
    using the system diff.

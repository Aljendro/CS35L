1. -If the other teams would have
   been looking at the stream of
   bytes going between the 
   the computers they would not
   be able to see what anything
   was becauase everything would
   have been encrypted
   1) If they had access to the 
   keystrokes on either computer
   they would have full access
   to our passwords because 
   anything that is typed on 
   either end is not encrypted
   2) If we are now booting off
   the usb and they have physical
   control of that usb, then the 
   Cracker could potentially be
   able to gain access to the 
   private key, which would allow
   them to gain access to our
   information.

2. The gpg --verify command doesn't
   really verify that someone 
   personally created the tar file
   because it can't verify the
   origin of the tar file. There
   is no way that you can verify 
   that a key came from a particular
   person. The way we combat that
   problem is to have third-parties
   that are trusted to verify
   that a key originated from a 
   particular person.

1. The first thing we had to do
   was to download OpenSSH
   1) sudo apt-get update
   2) sudo apt-get install openssh-server
   3) sudo apt-get install openssh-client 

2. The first position that I got
   to try out was the admin 
   position.


3. We tried the following steps:
   1) ssh-keygen ( to make the pub.
      		   and priv. RSA keys
   2) sudo useradd -d /home/<name> -m <name>
   3) sudo passwd <name> ( created the password
      	   	  	   partner)
   4) cd /home/<name>
   5) Already had the .ssh directory so I didn't
      create a new one
   6) sudo chown -R <name> .ssh 
   7) sudo chmod 700 (allows permisions to client)
   8) ifconfig (to get my IP addr to give to client)
  
   There were some issues that we ran into where the
   permsissions were set improperly. The TA managed
   to track these problems. The permissions for
   the .ssh directory were improperly set. Used
   chmod to fix problem.

4. Tried the client side steps:

   1) ssh-keygen ( generate new keys)
   2) ping <ip-address> ( given to me by partner
      	   		  check for response)
   3) ssh-copy-id -i is_rsa.pub <name>@<ip-address>
      a) able to log in with password now
   4) ssh-add is_rsa.pub
      a) use this to add our priv. key to ssh agent
      	 we can passwordless login
   5) ssh -X <name>@<ip-address>
   6) Tested the sesssion with Firefox and worked 
      properly.

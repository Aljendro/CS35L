<h1>Assignment 7. System call programming and debugging</h1>

<h2>Useful pointers</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Franco Callari, <a
  href='http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~franco/OpSys-304-427/lecture-notes/node18.html'>Block-oriented
  I/O in Unix</a> (1996)</li>
 <li><a href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/'>The Open Group Base
  Specifications Issue 7, IEEE Std 1003.1-2013</a> is the official
  standard for system calls and some higher-level library calls.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Laboratory: Buffered versus unbuffered I/O</h2>

<p>As usual, keep a log in the file <samp>lab.txt</samp> of what you
do in the lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should
not merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
what happened.</p>

<p>For this laboratory, you will implement the same program
using both buffered and unbuffered I/O, and compare the resulting
implementations and performance.</p>

<ol>

<li>Write a C program <samp>catb.c</samp> that uses <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getchar.html'><samp>getchar</samp></a>
and <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/putchar.html'><samp>putchar</samp></a>
to copy all the bytes in standard input to standard output. This is
roughly equivalent to the <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cat.html'><samp>cat</samp></a>
command with no arguments.</li>

<li>Write a C program <samp>catu.c</samp> that uses <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/read.html'><samp>read</samp></a>
and <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/write.html'><samp>write</samp></a>
to read and write each byte, instead of using <samp>getchar</samp> and
<samp>putchar</samp>. The <var>nbyte</var> arguments to
<samp>read</samp> and <samp>write</samp> should be 1, so that the
program reads and writes single bytes at a time.</li>

<li>Use the <samp>strace</samp> command to compare the system calls
issued by your <samp>catb</samp> and <samp>catu</samp> commands (a)
when copying one file to another, and (b) when copying a file to your
terminal. Use a file that contains at least 5,000,000 bytes.</li>

<li>Use the <a
href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/time.html'><samp>time</samp></a>
command to measure how much faster one program is, compared to the
other, when copying the same amount of data.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Homework: Encrypted sort revisited</h2>

<p>Rewrite the <samp>srot13</samp> program you wrote for Homework 5
so that it uses system calls rather than <samp>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</samp>
to read standard input and write standard output.
If standard input is a regular file, your program should
initially allocate enough memory to hold all the data in that file all at
once, rather than
the usual algorithm of reallocating memory as you go. However, if
the regular file grows while you are reading it, your program should
still work, by allocating more memory after the initial file size has
been read.</p>

<p>Your program should do one thing in addition to the Homework 5
program.  If successful, it should use
the <samp><a href='http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fprintf.html'>fprintf</a></samp>
function to output a line of the following form to standard error
before finishing:</p>

<pre><samp>Number of comparisons: 23451
</samp></pre>

<p>where the integer "23451" is replaced by the actual number of
comparisons done by your program, and where a "comparison" is an
invocation of <samp>rot13cmp</samp> to compare
two input lines. The line should be worded exactly
as above: for example, it should contain exactly three spaces. It
should be terminated with a newline.</p>

<p>Call the rewritten program
<samp>srot13u</samp>. Measure any differences in performance between
<samp>srot13</samp> and <samp>srot13u</samp> using the
<samp>time</samp> command. Run your program on inputs of varying
numbers of input lines, and estimate the number of comparisons as a
function of the number of input lines.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit the following files.</p>

<ul>

<li>The files <samp>lab.txt</samp>, <samp>catb.c</samp>, and
<samp>catu.c</samp> as described in the lab.</li>

<li>A single source file <samp>srot13u.c</samp> as described in the
homework.</li>

<li>A text file <samp>srot13.txt</samp> containing the results of
your srot13 performance comparison as described in the homework.</li>

</ul>

<p>All files should be ASCII text files, with no
carriage returns, and with no more than 200 columns per line.
The C source file should contain no more than 132 columns per line.
The shell
commands</p>

<pre><samp>expand lab.txt srot13.txt |
  awk '/\r/ || 200 &lt; length'
expand catb.c catu.c srot13u.c |
  awk '/\r/ || 132 &lt; length'
</samp></pre>

<p>should output nothing.</p>
